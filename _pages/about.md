<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 0.9em;">
I am a second-year Ph.D. in Economics at <a href="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/gigh6797-1.661797">Stockholm University</a> and a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.su.se/institute-for-international-economic-studies/">Institute for International Economic Studies</a> (IIES). I am interested in understanding how culture and identity shape people’s economic and social behavior, with a specific focus on the evolution of social norms and human capital investments in both developed and developing settings.
<br><br>
I earned a MSc in Economic and Social Sciences from <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/en">Bocconi University</a> and a MRes in Economics from the <a href="https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics">European University Institute</a>. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked for several years as a Field Coordinator for ERC and J-PAL funded RCTs in the domain of development and education.</p>
